To be moved to lomse_document.h

The Document class is a facade object that contains, basically, the internal model for the MusicXML or LDP document. The Document class encapsulates all the internals, providing the basic API for creating, modifying and using a document.

It is an observable class and, therefore, inherits methods for notifying observers (other registered objects) when changes occur to the document. For example, when the document is modified.

From a Lomse user application point of view, the main mechanism for creating a Document is by requesting it to the %LomseDoorway object. See LomseDoorway class for details on using the library and creating documents.

The main content of a Document is the @IM. It is something similar to the DOM in HTML. By accessing and modifying this internal model you have full control over the document content.

A Document can be created:

- From a file containing the document source code in any of the file formats supported (see @ref page-file-formats).
- From a string, also containing the source code.
- Or, dynamically, by creating an empty Document and inject content by issuing edition commands or by direct creation and manipulation of the internal data structures that form the @IM.

The Document can also be created and modified by program. Commands on the Document and direct manipulation of the @IM give full flexibility for this. An special LDP tag @<dynamic@> instructs Lomse to require from your application the content to be inserted at that point. This is something analogous to the HTML @<object@> tag.
