Thanks for taking the time to contribute!


## Do you have questions about the project?

Feel free to ask any question in the [lomse mail list](https://sourceforge.net/p/lomse/mailman/). I always answer the posts.


## How can I contribute?

### Report bugs, propose new features or send feedback

If you encountered a bug, please tell about it. Go to the lomse [issues page](https://github.com/lenmus/lomse/issues) and create a new issue. Explain what you did and how you encountered it, and what happened afterwards. Most importantly, state how to go about and recreate the same error.

I would like very much to know how you feel about the software and hear your suggestions for improvements, new features, etc. Please, go to the lomse [issues page](https://github.com/lenmus/lomse/issues) and create a new issue. Explain your ideas, suggestions and requests.

Send your feedback to improve the library and fix the bugs you find. Thank you!



### Programming

Unsure where to begin contributing to lomse? You can start by looking through these issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - Issues labeled with `beginner` do not require deep knowledge of lomse internals so they are suitable for start contributing with code to this project.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - To do or complete issues labeled as `help-wanted` I need help (advice, explanations or code) because I do not have enough knowledge for doing the task. Perhaps you have the knowledge and can help me!

If you would like to join this project, you are welcome. I'm currently the only developer, so I would like to find a few committed developers to create a core team. If you are interested and would like to take this project as your own project, you are welcome. The project has no commercial aim, so do not expect any money. I do this in my free time, for learning and for creating useful free software for the community. And costs me money!
