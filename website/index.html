<h1>The Lomse project</h1>

<p>LenMus open music score edition library (Lomse library) for C++ is a free open source library to add capabilities to any program for editing, rendering and playing back music scores. It is witten in C++ and it is platform independent.</p>

<p>Lomse is based on the experience gained developping the <a href="http://www.lenmus.org/">LenMus project</a> and it is, currently a work in progress.
</p>


<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I'm doing my best to insure that this library is developed following a test driven approach. As such I will accept no code changes without associated tests. As for bug fixes I plan to follow the same procedure: write a failing unit test first and then fix it. In this fashion, the number of tests that we have will grow over time. Lastly, if a change breaks an existing test it is the responsibility of the person making the change to first understand the ramification of the change and either fix the test or alter the modification that caused the problem. That said, if you are interested, so are I, please help make Lomse a great library to help to create applications for musicians.</p>
