# Sample: tempoline

This sample shows how to control the tempo line visual tracking effect when an external player is used. It is assumed that the external player will provide information to determine current measure and beat.

In this sample, the player is simulated by a timer. The timer event simulates the event generated by the external player, and the measure and beat information that the player would provide is simulated by just incrementing measure and beat counters. Then, this information is used to control the tempo line visual tracking effect.
